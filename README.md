# Traffiti
A Smart Traffic Controller implementing Reinforcement Learning to reshape how urbanites move around!

### Tech Stacks <br />
Python * Keras * Numpy * SUMO * TraCI

### Inspiration <br />
While driving on Sherbrooke Street, at numerous intersections, it came to mind that transportation in general could be improved by attacking traffic light management.

### What <br />
Traffiti controls the traffic lights intelligently by using data on the current traffic to determine which traffic light pattern is the most appropriate to reduce overall wait time for drivers.

### How <br />
use Keras with reinforcement learning on SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility), a traffic simulation software, to train the underlying algorithm that Traffiti is run on.

### Challenges <br />
The setup, learning the TraCI (Traffic Control Interface), which is the SUMO API, and familiarizing with reinforcement learning with Keras.

### Accomplishments <br />
Able to dig out a solution from a complex research paper "An Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning Model for Urban Traffic Control" and tried some cool technologies! (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.01876.pdf)

### What's next for Traffiti <br />
- Implement Traffiti IRL using computer vision
- Develop more features like protected lights, pedestrians, multi-lanes
- Store vehicle data for future usage on insurance, statistics, etc.
